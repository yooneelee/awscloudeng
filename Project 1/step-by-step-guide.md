# Project 1

Level: Beginner

In this project, I created an S3 bucket to hold sales data and connect Amazon QuickSight to perform data analysis and produce dashboards for business insights. 

Here is a step by step guide to complete this project. 

### *Step 1*

- Navigate to S3 to create an S3 bucket.
- Give a unique name to the bucket (e.g., project1bucket)
- Keep all other settings default.
- Finalise and create bucket.

### *Step 2*

- Download the following files located in the 'downloads' folder in this directory (Amazon-Bestseller-Dasaset.csv & manifest.json)
- Open the json file (via text editor of choice) and replace 'BUCKETNAME' with your bucket name.
- Upload the bot files into the S3 bucket (created in step 1).

### *Step 3*

- Navigate to Amazon QuickSight and create an account.
- Allow S3 to be a resource connection.
- Once in the portal, create a new dataset and input the relative fields to connect to your S3 bucket. 
- Proceed to 'Analyses' to create BI graphs using the data in your S3 bucket.
